\caption{RMSE $[\mathrm{D}]$ of \ac{ML} dipole models for \ac{PG} and PG2. The \ce{CO}, \ce{O}, and \ce{OH} models were trained for reference purposes and were not used for spectrum calculations. The CO+Olp+OH and CO+Olp+CO represents the COH and COC dipoles calculated from these three models, respectively.}
