# Author Response to Referee Reports Template

## Overview

This LaTeX template provides a structured framework for creating formal responses to peer review comments during the academic publication process. It's designed to help authors organize their responses point-by-point, clearly distinguishing between reviewer comments and author responses while providing convenient formatting to highlight changes made to the manuscript.

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Setup

1. Update the paper metadata at the top of the document:
   ```latex
   \def\papertitle{Paper Title}
   \def\authors{Author Name}
   \def\journal{}
   \def\doi{}
   ```

2. Customize the letter title if needed:
   ```latex
   \providecommand{\lettertitle}{Author Response to Reviews of}
   ```

### Adding Reviewer Comments and Responses

The template provides special commands for reviewer comments and author responses:

- **Reviewer Comments**:
  ```latex
  \RC Your reviewer's comment goes here.
  ```
  This formats the text in bold italic with "RC:" prefix.

- **Author Responses**:
  ```latex
  \AR Your response to the reviewer goes here.
  ```
  This formats the text with "AR:" prefix.

- **Alternative Formatting**:
  ```latex
  \RC* Comment without prefix
  \AR* Response without prefix
  ```

### Highlighting Changes

The template integrates with LaTeX-diff to show additions and deletions:

```latex
\DIFadd{Added text appears like this}
\DIFdel{Deleted text appears like this}
```

### Quoting Revised Manuscript Text

Use the quote environment to show excerpts from your revised manuscript:

```latex
\begin{quote}
Text from your manuscript. \DIFadd{New additions.} \DIFdel{Removed content.}
\end{quote}
```
